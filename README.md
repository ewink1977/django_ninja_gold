#Ninja Gold!

Program created as a Coding Dojo assignment using the django framework.

There are two ways of processing the game, the index.html file uses POST method to randomly check how much gold a ninja should earn (or lose) based on
where he or she looks. The getindex.html file uses URL parameters to determine what should be done. The version of the game can easily be switched by choosing
which html file is loaded in the urls.py file.

The game uses Bootstrap for some basic styling, as well as some local modifications.

The next step will be to create win and loss conditions.
